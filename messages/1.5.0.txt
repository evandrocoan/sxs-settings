Side-by-Side Settings - Version 1.5.0

A new "filter_platform" option has been added (default: true). When enabled,
the file selection panel will filter out platform specific files that do not
match your current platform (i.e. Linux and OSX files will be filtered out
when on Windows). Thanks to Ben Felder for this suggestion!
